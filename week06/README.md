#### NASA's Perseverance Secret Parachute Message

For fun - NASA's Perseverance Mars Lander had a [secret message encoded in its parachute](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-parachute-hidden-message-binary-code/). This file recreates the pattern on the parachute, and translates the encoded statement, which requires a few back-and-forths between [decimal, binary, and ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com). It's great tree management practice!
