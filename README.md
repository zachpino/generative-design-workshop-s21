### Course Online Resources

Like all courses affected by the ongoing pandemic, we will use a combination of online platforms alongside (hopefully soon) in-person facilities through the semester.  

- Zoom for *unrecorded* class discussions (check your email for the link)
- [This Github page](https://github.com/zachpino/generative-design-workshop-s21) for resource collection, presentations, and formal assignment documentation
- [Miro]() for collaborative class sessions and file exchange (We may also occasionally need Google Drive for large file distribution)
